/**
 *  This class implements the TERM operator for all retrieval models.
 *  The TERM operator stores a query term, for example "apple" in the
 *  query "#AND (apple pie).  Although it may seem odd to use a query
 *  operator to store a term, doing so makes it easy to build
 *  structured queries with nested query operators.
