 *  All query operators return QryResult objects.  QryResult objects
 *  encapsulate the inverted lists (InvList) produced by QryopIl query
 *  operators and the score lists (ScoreList) produced by QryopSl
 *  query operators.  QryopIl query operators populate the
 *  invertedList and and leave the docScores empty.  QryopSl query
 *  operators leave the invertedList empty and populate the docScores.
 *  Encapsulating the two types of Qryop results in a single class
 *  makes it easy to build structured queries with nested query
 *  operators.
